            <abstract>This data layer of California public school locations displays the performance of schools and student groups on a set of state indicators reported in the 2019 California School Dashboard. The Dashboard is the reporting tool used in California's school accountability system and provides parents and educators with meaningful information on school and district progress so they can participate in decisions to improve student learning. California's accountability model measures the performance and progress of students using six state indicators that includes Math / English Language Arts (ELA) assessments, college/career preparedness , chronic absenteeism rates, graduation rates and suspension rates. Schools receive one of five color-coded performance levels for each indicator. From highest to lowest, the five performance levels are: Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, and Red. Performance levels are calculated based on how current year data (Status) compares to prior year data (Change).The school districts represented in this data set are limited to those that have geographically defined service areas. Other entities defined as school districts in the California School Dashboard that are not defined geographically are excluded such as county offices of education, SBE charters and state special schools.The school enrollment and demographic information are based on the 2018-19 academic year student enrollment counts collected on Fall Census Day in 2018 (first Wednesday in October). These data elements are collected by the CDE through the California Longitudinal Achievement System (CALPADS) and can be accessed as publicly downloadable files from the Data &amp;amp; Statistics web page on the CDE website.A single school receives multiple performance colors, one for each indicator and student group.</abstract>
